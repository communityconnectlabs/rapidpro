#### **1.4 Architecture of RapidPro (Continued)**

**Detailed Architecture Components**:

1. **Flow Engine**

    * The core logic processor of RapidPro.
    * Evaluates triggers, executes actions, and navigates users through decision trees.
    * Supports real-time execution for high performance.

   **Code Example**: Flow Trigger Example

    ```json
    {
        "trigger": {
            "type": "message",
            "conditions": {
                "channel": "sms",
                "keywords": ["start"]
            }
        },
        "actions": [
            {
                "type": "send_message",
                "channel": "sms",
                "content": "Welcome! Let's get started with our survey."
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

2. **Channel Layer**

    * Acts as the intermediary between RapidPro and communication platforms.
    * Supports protocols like HTTP, SMPP, and platform-specific APIs.

   **Example Channel Configuration**:

    ```yaml
    channels:
        - name: Twilio SMS
          type: twilio
          credentials:
              account_sid: "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
              auth_token: "your_auth_token"
          phone_number: "+1234567890"
    ```

3. **Data Store**

    * A relational database system that manages:
        * Contacts and their attributes.
        * Message histories.
        * Flow progress and metadata.

   **Common Tables**:

    * `contacts`: Stores user profiles.
    * `flows`: Metadata about workflows.
    * `messages`: Logs sent and received messages.
4. **API Gateway**

    * Facilitates integration with external services.
    * Provides RESTful endpoints for programmatic flow control, user management, and analytics.

   **API Example**: Fetching Flow Runs

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://api.rapidpro.io/api/v2/runs.json" \
         -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```


* * *

#### **2.2 Configuration and Environment Setup**

Once the installation is complete, the next step involves configuring RapidPro to suit your specific requirements. Proper configuration ensures the platform runs smoothly and integrates seamlessly with your chosen channels and services.

* * *

**Step 1: Configuring Channels**

Channels are the communication pathways RapidPro uses to send and receive messages. The platform supports multiple channels, including SMS, WhatsApp, and social media.

**1. Adding an SMS Channel**  
RapidPro supports SMS gateways like Twilio and Nexmo. To configure an SMS channel:

* Go to the RapidPro admin interface.
* Navigate to **Channels > Add Channel**.
* Select the desired SMS gateway from the list.
* Enter your gateway credentials.

Example: Twilio SMS Channel Configuration

```yaml
channels:
  - name: Twilio SMS
    type: twilio
    credentials:
      account_sid: "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
      auth_token: "your_auth_token"
    phone_number: "+1234567890"
```

**2. Adding a WhatsApp Channel**  
WhatsApp integration requires access to the WhatsApp Business API:

* Obtain credentials from your WhatsApp Business account.
* Add a new channel in RapidPro and select "WhatsApp".
* Enter the API key, phone number, and callback URL.

* * *

**Step 2: Setting Up Contact Fields and Groups**

Contacts are at the heart of RapidPro. Configuration involves defining attributes and organizing contacts into groups.

**1. Adding Contact Fields**  
Contact fields allow you to store metadata about each user (e.g., name, age, or location).

* Navigate to **Contacts > Fields** in the admin interface.
* Add fields using predefined types (e.g., text, number, or date).

**Example Contact Field Structure**:

```json
{
    "name": "age",
    "type": "number",
    "description": "Age of the contact"
}
```

**2. Organizing Contacts into Groups**  
Groups allow segmentation for targeted communication.

* Navigate to **Contacts > Groups** and create new groups.
* Add contacts manually or through automated workflows.

* * *

**Step 3: Configuring the Environment**

**1. Environment Variables**  
RapidPro relies on environment variables for runtime configuration. Update your `.env` file to reflect your settings.

Example `.env` Configuration:

```bash
DEBUG=False
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/rapidpro
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
SECRET_KEY=your-production-secret-key
ALLOWED_HOSTS=yourdomain.com
```

**2. Static Files**  
Collect static assets for production use:

```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```

**3. Security Settings**

* Set `DEBUG=False` in production.
* Configure SSL for secure communication.
* Define `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to restrict access to specific domains.

* * *

**Step 4: Testing the Setup**

Verify that all services and configurations are working as expected:

* **Messaging Test**: Send a test message through a configured channel.
* **Flow Execution**: Trigger a test flow and validate the results.
* **API Access**: Test API endpoints to ensure connectivity.

* * *

#### **2.3 First Steps: Creating Your First Flow**

The flow is the foundational building block in RapidPro. This section walks you through creating a simple survey flow.

* * *

**1. Define the Objective**  
Objective: Create a flow that asks users for their feedback and stores the response.

**2. Use the Flow Editor**

* Navigate to **Flows > Create New Flow**.
* Drag and drop blocks to create the following sequence:
    1. **Start**: Trigger the flow via SMS keyword (e.g., "FEEDBACK").
    2. **Send Message**: "Thank you for participating! Please rate your experience from 1 to 5."
    3. **Wait for Response**: Use a "Wait for response" block to capture user input.
    4. **Store Response**: Save the response in a contact field (e.g., `feedback_rating`).

Mermaid Diagram: Survey Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[Send Message: Rate your experience]
    B --> C[Wait for Response]
    C --> D[Store Response: feedback_rating]
    D --> E[End]
```

**3. Publish and Test the Flow**

* Save and publish the flow.
* Test it by sending the keyword "FEEDBACK" to the configured channel.

* * *

**4. Example: Exporting the Flow**  
Flows can be exported and shared as JSON files.

Example Flow JSON Export:

```json
{
    "name": "Feedback Survey",
    "trigger": {
        "type": "message",
        "conditions": {
            "channel": "sms",
            "keywords": ["FEEDBACK"]
        }
    },
    "actions": [
        {
            "type": "send_message",
            "content": "Thank you for participating! Please rate your experience from 1 to 5."
        },
        {
            "type": "wait_for_response",
            "input_type": "number",
            "save_to_field": "feedback_rating"
        }
    ]
}
```

* * *

### Chapter 3: Core Concepts

* * *

#### **3.1 Flows and Triggers**

**What Are Flows?**  
Flows are the core units of interaction in RapidPro. They represent step-by-step workflows that guide communication with users based on inputs, decisions, and predefined actions.

* * *

**Flow Structure**:

1. **Triggers**: Initiate a flow based on specific events or conditions (e.g., a keyword or API call).
2. **Actions**: Define tasks performed within the flow, such as sending a message or saving data.
3. **Rules**: Evaluate user input and make decisions to guide the flow.

* * *

**Creating a Flow**: Example Walkthrough

Objective: Design a flow that collects a user’s name and age and stores this information in their contact profile.

**Step 1: Define the Trigger**  
Use an SMS keyword, such as "INFO", to start the flow:

* Trigger Type: Message
* Condition: Keywords = INFO

**Step 2: Add Actions**

1. **Send Message**: "Hello! What's your name?"
2. **Wait for Response**: Capture user input and save it as a variable (`name`).
3. **Send Message**: "Thanks, [name]! How old are you?"
4. **Wait for Response**: Capture the age and save it as `age`.
5. **End Flow**: Confirm data collection is complete.

**Flow Diagram**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start: INFO Trigger] --> B["Send: What's your name?"]
    B --> C["Wait for Response: Save as 'name'"]
    C --> D["Send: How old are you?"]
    D --> E["Wait for Response: Save as 'age'"]
    E --> F["End: Confirm Data Collection"]
```

* * *

**Flow Triggers**

Triggers define how users enter a flow. Supported types include:

1. **Message Triggers**: Initiated by specific keywords sent by users.
2. **Time-Based Triggers**: Automatically start flows at scheduled times.
3. **Webhook Triggers**: Initiated by external API calls.

**Example: Webhook Trigger Configuration**  
Webhook triggers allow external systems to start flows. Configure the webhook by specifying:

* URL: `https://your-rapidpro-instance.com/webhooks/start_flow`
* Payload: Include user data and any required metadata.

* * *

#### **3.2 Channels: Connecting to Communication Platforms**

Channels are how RapidPro communicates with users. Common channel types include SMS, WhatsApp, and social media platforms.

**Steps to Add a New Channel**:

1. Navigate to **Channels > Add Channel**.
2. Select a channel type (e.g., Twilio, Facebook Messenger).
3. Enter the required credentials or API keys.
4. Test the connection to ensure messages can be sent and received.

**Example: Configuring a Telegram Channel**

* Obtain a Telegram bot token from the BotFather.
* Add the bot token to RapidPro’s channel configuration.

```yaml
channels:
  - name: Telegram Bot
    type: telegram
    credentials:
      bot_token: "123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11"
```

* * *

**Testing Channel Integration**  
After adding a channel:

* Send a test message through the RapidPro admin interface.
* Verify that the message is received on the target platform.

* * *

#### **3.3 Users and Contacts**

**Contacts**:  
Contacts are users that interact with your RapidPro flows. Each contact has:

* **Attributes**: Key-value pairs storing metadata (e.g., `name`, `age`).
* **Groups**: Collections of contacts for targeted communication.

**Managing Contacts**:

* Add contacts manually or import a CSV file.
* Update attributes via API or within flows.

**Example Contact Profile**:

```json
{
    "uuid": "1234-5678",
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "age": 25,
    "groups": ["Subscribers"]
}
```

**Dynamic Contact Attributes**:  
Attributes can be updated dynamically during a flow. For example:

* Save a user’s response as an attribute (`name = response`).
* Use conditional logic to update specific fields.

* * *

#### **3.4 Expressions and Variables**

Expressions and variables allow for dynamic content and decision-making in flows.

* * *

**Using Variables**: Variables are placeholders for dynamic data, such as contact attributes or flow responses.

* Syntax: `@<variable_name>`
* Example: "Hello, @name! Thanks for providing your age: @age."

**Supported Variable Types**:

1. **Contact Variables**: Data stored in contact profiles (e.g., `@name`, `@email`).
2. **Flow Variables**: Data captured during the flow.
3. **System Variables**: Metadata like timestamps or message IDs.

* * *

**Conditional Logic**: RapidPro supports expressions for decision-making in flows:

* **If-Else Conditions**: Evaluate expressions to guide the flow.
* **Arithmetic and String Operations**: Perform calculations or manipulate text.

**Example Expression**:

```yaml
if "@age" >= 18:
    send_message("You're eligible for the survey!")
else:
    send_message("Sorry, you must be at least 18 to participate.")
```

* * *

### Chapter 4: Advanced Features

* * *

#### **4.1 Webhooks and API Integration**

Webhooks and APIs extend RapidPro’s functionality by enabling real-time communication with external systems.

* * *

**Webhooks: Triggering External Actions**

Webhooks allow RapidPro to notify external services when specific events occur within a flow. For example, a webhook can be triggered to update an external database or initiate another workflow.

**Setting Up a Webhook in a Flow**:

1. In the flow editor, add a "Call Webhook" action.
2. Specify the webhook URL and optional headers.
3. Define the payload to send. This can include flow variables, contact attributes, and metadata.

**Example Webhook Configuration**:

```json
{
    "url": "https://api.example.com/update",
    "method": "POST",
    "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer your_api_key"
    },
    "body": {
        "contact_id": "@contact.uuid",
        "name": "@contact.name",
        "response": "@response"
    }
}
```

**Webhook Response Handling**:  
RapidPro can process webhook responses to update flow variables or trigger further actions:

* Use a "Wait for Response" block to capture the result.
* Parse the response using RapidPro expressions.

* * *

**API Integration**

RapidPro provides a REST API for programmatically interacting with the platform. Common use cases include:

1. Managing contacts and groups.
2. Triggering flows.
3. Retrieving analytics data.

**Example: Triggering a Flow via API**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-rapidpro-instance.com/api/v2/flows/start.json" \
    -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "flow": "feedback_survey",
        "contacts": ["1234-5678"]
    }'
```

**Fetching Contact Data**  
Retrieve details of a specific contact:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://your-rapidpro-instance.com/api/v2/contacts.json?uuid=1234-5678" \
    -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY"
```

* * *

#### **4.2 Conditional Logic and Rules**

Conditional logic allows flows to adapt based on user inputs or other criteria.

* * *

**Rule Types**:

1. **Expression Rules**: Evaluate conditions using variables.
    * Example: `@age >= 18`
2. **Keyword Rules**: Check user responses for specific words or phrases.
    * Example: User replies with "yes" or "no".
3. **Randomization Rules**: Split users into groups for A/B testing or controlled experiments.

**Creating Rules in a Flow**:

1. Add a "Split by Expression" block.
2. Define conditions for each path.
3. Connect subsequent actions based on the evaluation.

**Example: Survey Qualification Flow**:

```yaml
if "@age >= 18":
    send_message("You're eligible for the survey!")
else:
    send_message("Sorry, you must be at least 18 to participate.")
```

        def send_message(self, to, content):
            # Logic to send message via Twilio API
            pass
    ```

2. **Message Queues**:

    * Integrates with Celery for background task processing.
    * Redis or RabbitMQ is used as the message broker.
3. **Delivery Reports**:

    * Tracks message delivery status and updates the system accordingly.

* * *

**Example Courier Message Dispatch**:

```json
{
    "channel": "twilio",
    "to": "+1234567890",
    "content": "Your appointment is confirmed.",
    "metadata": {
        "delivery_time": "2024-12-03T10:00:00Z"
    }
}
```

* * *

### **4. Interaction Between Mailroom and Courier**

Mailroom and Courier collaborate to provide seamless flow execution and message delivery.

1. **Flow Execution**:

    * Mailroom determines the next step in the workflow, such as sending a message.
    * Generates a message request, which is passed to Courier.
2. **Message Dispatch**:

    * Courier processes the message request and delivers it to the intended channel.
3. **Response Handling**:

    * User responses are routed back to Mailroom via Courier, enabling dynamic flow progression.

* * *

### **5. Best Practices for Extending Mailroom and Courier**

1. **Modular Design**:

    * Keep logic isolated to Mailroom for flows and Courier for messaging.
2. **Testing in Isolation**:

    * Use mock APIs to test Mailroom and Courier independently.
