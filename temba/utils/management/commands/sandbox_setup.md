# Sandbox Configuration Tool for RapidPro

## Description

The `sandbox_setup` command is a dev/sandbox fixture management tool designed to extend RapidProâ€™s capabilities. By combining the functionality of test databases with enhanced configurability and version control, the tool will:

1. Enable resetting organizations, users, and flows to initial predefined states.
2. Standardize UUIDs across environments to ensure consistency.
3. Allow data migration for sandbox flows, organizations, and configurations, keeping them current through version tracking and a lightweight Erlang-style `code_up` methodology for upgrades.
4. Offer configurable and optional components, allowing granular control over which organizations, flows, and related entities are included in the sandbox environment.
5. Apply database changes without requiring a full flush, enabling faster iteration cycles.

By addressing these key points, the tool provides a consistent and efficient environment for running end-to-end tests, integrating components like Courier and Mailroom, and collaborating on configurations.
